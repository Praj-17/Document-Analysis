By using standard vee-dies, cost savings can be realized through economical set-ups and run times on small lots and prototypes. In addition to these considerations, using the following guidelines will increase the manufacturability of designs for press brake forming.', '', 'Dimension the part in a single direction wherever possible. Because of the sequential nature of the forming process, and the fact that dimensional variation is introduced at each bend, dimensioning in a single direction parallels the process and helps to control tolerance accumulation. Furthermore, allow a more generous bend tolerance (+/- .007”) as tighter tolerances, while achievable, will result in higher costs.', '', 'Use consistent bend radius for all bends per part, when possible—it helps minimize setup changes. Additionally, we prefer radii specs in fractions of an inch, as our tooling is sized accordingly.', '', 'Generally, dimensioning should be done from a feature to an edge.

The smallest cut possible is dictated by the width of the beam or .008"" wide.', '', '', '', 'Material restrictions – Materials have three factors that restrict them from laser cutting. These factors are reflectivity, thickness and flammability. Reflectivity causes a problem because the cutting beam gets scattered. Material that is too thick has the same problem: molten metal scatters the beam before the part is fully cut. We can cut metal as thick as 3/8"" but the edge quality suffers greatly. The degree of material flammability is another important factor. Some parts considered flammable can be used. It is best to test flammable or heat sensitive materials before releasing a production part. Below is a list of some of the material we have used.', '', 'Acceptable Materials', '', 'Any raw steel (Stainless, CRS, HRS)', 'Aluminum Some deburring issues', 'Plastic Check heat & flammability', 'Cardstock Check heat & flammability', 'Galvanized, Galvaneal', '', 'Unacceptable Materials', '', 'Copper Highly reflective']"

When dimensioning for the turret, select meaningful datum in the body of the part—passing through hole centers, if possible—rather than using an edge or corner of the part. Edges can be tapered or misaligned and result in enough variance to be dimensionally uncertain. Furthermore, the use of meaningful datum facilitates inspection.', '', 'Special forms – The turret punch press offers many versatile solutions for putting special features into a flat sheet. Some of the options are counter sinks, offsets, card guides, embosses, draws, wipe forms, part markings, lettering, lances, half-shears, and weld projections. Virtually any form can be made as long as it falls within the following constraints. The form depth must be less than 5/16"" and it must fit into a 3.5"" diameter circle.
