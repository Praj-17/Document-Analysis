In addition to these considerations, using the | following guidelines will increase the manufacturability of designs for press brake forming. |',\n",
       " '<p>Dimension the part in a single direction wherever possible. Because of the sequential nature of | the forming process, and the fact that dimensional variation is introduced at each bend, | dimensioning in a single direction parallels the process and helps to control tolerance | accumulation.  Furthermore, allow a more generous bend tolerance (+/- .007”) as tighter | tolerances, while achievable, will result in higher costs. |',\n",

       " '<p>Tolerances  – The feature to feature tolerance for the turret press is +/-.004”, the punched hole | tolerance is +/-.002”.  When dimensioning for the turret, select meaningful datum in the body of | the part—passing through hole centers, if possible—rather than using an edge or corner of the | part.  Edges can be tapered or misaligned and result in enough variance to be dimensionally | uncertain.  Furthermore, the use of meaningful datum facilitates inspection. |',\n",

Some of the options are counter sinks, offsets, card guides, embosses, | draws, wipe forms, part markings, lettering, lances, half-shears, and weld projections. Virtually | any form can be made as long as it falls within the following constraints. The form depth must be | less than 5/16\" and it must fit into a 3.5\" diameter circle.
